# Introduction


## Whistleblowing

give a definition of whistleblowing

    Jubb: "Whistleblowing is a deliberate non-obligatory act of disclosure, which gets onto public record and is made by a person who has or had privileged access to data or information of an organisation, about non-trivial illegality or other wrongdoing whether actual, suspected or anticipated which implicates and is under the control of that organisation, to an external entity having potential to rectify the wrongdoing." (3)

    public accusations necessitate being disloyal to the organization (3) (organization seeks to keep information private)

    ehtical conflict between personal and organisational values

    whistleblowers are popuralry associated with spies -> difference: whistleblowing is emplyoed indiscriminately , the more the better

    jurisdiction needs to isolate whistleblowers from spies -> whistleblowing has social benefits for the general public

show how this topic is relevant for democracies, freedom of speech

    dilemma: public has a right to know but organizations require loyalty and secrecy (1)

    Different parts of that world and different cultures might discuss the issue in different terms, but having to deal with the issue seems to have become a global thing. (1)

    whistleblwoing: control instrument (should therefore be encouraged)

Freedom of Press Foundation

    state its standpoint (2)
