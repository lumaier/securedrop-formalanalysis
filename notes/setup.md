# Setup

The setup of a SecureDrop instance involves several enrollment steps where authenticity of the participating parties' public keys is verified. As depicted in Figure 1, first, the newsroom is enrolled by the FPF which holds a signature key whose public key is known to every party in the system.
Once the newsroom is set up, it can enroll multiple journalists accountable for reading and responding to submission of the source. The source doesn't need to be enrolled but can access the instance on its own. This ensures the source's anonimity.
